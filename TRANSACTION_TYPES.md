2. **Withdrawals**: Look for keywords like "DEBIT PURCHASE", "CHARGES", "CCY CONVERSION FEE"
3. **Mixed**: Look for keywords like "PAYMENT /TRANSFER SUPP"

### **DBS Bank Rules:**

2. **Withdrawals**: Look for keywords like "FAST PAYMENT", "GIRO PAYMENT", "SERVICE CHARGE"
3. **Mixed**: Look for keywords like "FAST PAYMENT" and analyze context

## üìä **Amount Field Assignment**

### **OCBC Bank:**
- **Deposits**: Amount goes to `deposit` field, `withdrawal` = empty
- **Withdrawals**: Amount goes to `withdrawal` field, `deposit` = empty

### **DBS Bank:**
- **Deposits**: Amount goes to `deposit` field, `withdrawal` = empty
- **Withdrawals**: Amount goes to `withdrawal` field, `deposit` = empty

## üéØ **Implementation Notes**

### **Current Issues:**
1. **DBS processor** treats ALL transactions as withdrawals ‚ùå
2. **OCBC processor** has better logic but could be improved
3. **Transaction type detection** needs to be more sophisticated

### **Required Fixes:**
1. **DBS processor**: Implement proper deposit/withdrawal detection
2. **Both processors**: Use consistent transaction type keywords
3. **Amount assignment**: Ensure proper field mapping based on transaction type
